## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Bootstrap
- Sass/SCSS
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

- How to better use Bootstrap for responsive screen resizing. I implemented the col-lg-\* breakpoints to resize the column widths, based on screensize.

- How to do a double image background with svg images.

- The use of col-auto to use with variable width columns. 

- How to resize the svg background image for mobile as I used more screensizes than just 375px and 1440px and the provide svg for mobile was too small



### Continued development

- I'm continuing as well with tutorials in bootstrap , Sass/SCSS, and Javascript. 



### Useful resources

- [CSS background shorthand property ](https://www.webfx.com/blog/web-design/background-css-shorthand/) - Was useful in how to do double image background
